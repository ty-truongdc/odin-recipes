        <p>
            This salsa chicken recipe is very easy and quick! Someone gave me this recipe a few years back, and it has 
            beome a household favorite. Depending on your taste, you can use mild, medium, or hot salsa. I usually serve 
            it with Spanish rice and Mexican-style canned corn.
